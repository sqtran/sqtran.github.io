# Introduction

Welcome to the Danger Zone!

What you'll read throughout this blog are random ramblings that I thought would be interesting to share with the world.  A lot of these posts will probably be notes to self, but the goal is to brain dump all the useful knowledge out of my head to help others.

So sit back and prepare to read about all the stuff that I encountered in the world of technology!
