# Welcome to the Danger Zone!

As you can see, I invented blogging back in 1999.  

What you'll read throughout this blog are random ramblings that I thought would be interesting to share with the world. But mainly, these are things that I wasn't too lazy to  jot down, and neatly format into `Markdown`.

Sit back and prepare to re-read about stuff that you probably already knew.
