## Background
So this post is more of a reference for myself, since I frequently get asked these questions by customers.  What used to be just called JBoss, in version 4 and 5, eventually got rebranded as JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, or `EAP` for short.

JBoss AS was the community project, which has evolved into a new community project called `Wildfly`.

Versions of `EAP` don't directly correspond with versions of `Wildfly` though, as `EAP` is the "product" and `Wildfly` is the "project".  

A lot of bug fixes happen upstream, and eventually get ported back into the product by the Red Hat engineering team.  Since `EAP` is their supported offering, the bug fixes actually get ported back into multiple versions of `EAP`.


## References

These are awesome pages that get updated regularly, that describe the capabilities of the platform. Unfortunately, you gotta have a Red Hat account to view them, so not everyone can see how great they are.
