title: EAP 7.1.6 to 7.2.2 Gotchas
---

There are a few changes required when migrating to the latest JBoss EAP version.  For a minor release, these wrecked havoc on my EAP build playbook, and it took a few days to resolve.  While the differences are relatively small, it burnt a lot of time debugging, so hopefully these tips will help you out.

Note that all changes here only applies when running in `Domain` mode.  I'm not sure what the differences are, if any, when running in `Standalone`.

If your domain controller machine is configured as a host controller, you'll notice an issue with the worker node not being able to connect to the domain controller.  This is because the default `native-interface` was missing in the `host.xml`  in the `management-interfaces` stanza.  It's an easy fix.

```xml
<management-interfaces>
    <!-- Add the native-interface back -->
    <native-interface security-realm="ManagementRealm">
        <socket interface="management" port="${jboss.management.native.port:9999}"/>
    </native-interface>

    <http-interface http-authentication-factory="my-ldap-http-auth">
        <http-upgrade enabled="true" sasl-authentication-factory="my-ldap-sasl-auth"/>
        <socket interface="management" port="${jboss.management.http.port:9990}"/>
    </http-interface>
</management-interfaces>
```


If you have more than one machine, your worker nodes will need to configure their domain controller discovery options.

EAP 7.1.6 defaulted to the remote protocol and port 9999.

```xml
  <remote protocol="remote" host="${jboss.domain.master.address}" port="${jboss.domain.master.port:9999}" security-realm="ManagementRealm"/>
```

EAP 7.2.2 defaults to the remote+http protocol, and connects to port 9990 (in order to support the http upgrade protocol).  We just need to tweak the settings to default to remote and 9999.  You'll also need to check the security realm settings too.  If your `ManagementRealm` is able to authenticate your servers with the provided username, then there's nothing you need to do.  I had my servers authenticate using the Properties File realm, so I needed to remove the http upgrade in the protocol settings.

```xml
<remote security-realm="ManagementRealm">
   <discovery-options>
       <static-discovery name="primary" protocol="${jboss.domain.master.protocol:remote+http}"  host="${jboss.domain.master.address}" port="${jboss.domain.master.port:9990}"/>
   </discovery-options>
</remote>
```

It also looks like some of the `modcluster` configuration options have moved.

The old subsystem looked like this.
```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:modcluster:3.0">
    <mod-cluster-config advertise-socket="modcluster" connector="ajp">
        <dynamic-load-provider>
            <load-metric type="cpu"/>
        </dynamic-load-provider>
    </mod-cluster-config>
</subsystem>
```

But the new `modcluster` subsystem moved the `mod-cluster-config` into an element named `proxy`, but it takes the same (or similar) parameters.

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:modcluster:4.0">
  <proxy name="default" advertise-socket="modcluster" listener="ajp">
    <dynamic-load-provider>
      <load-metric type="cpu"/>
    </dynamic-load-provider>
  </proxy>
</subsystem>
```

Those are just the gotchas that I ran into so far.  I'm certain there are more things that need to be changed in the other subsystems that I haven't touched yet.  Let me know if you find anything that should be included.
